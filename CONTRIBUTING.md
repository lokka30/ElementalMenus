# Contribution Guidelines

## IDE

* **IntelliJ IDEA** is strongly recommended - it's free (and much better than Eclipse)!
* **Do not allow your IDE to automatically re-arrange code.** We have purposely grouped variables and methods together,
  and we would rather an IDE's reformatter not mess with it.

## Language

* All contributions **must** be written in **English**. Please use the 'US' version - for instance, 'color' should be
  spelt instead of 'colo**u**r'.

## Documentation

It is important that other developers clearly understand how your code works.

* **Javadocs** must be added to your code in your commits if methods and/or variables are possibly not self-explanatory
  to other developers.
* **New commands and permissions** should be clearly stated in commit descriptions so that the author is informed to
  adjust the Wiki accordingly.

## Style

* Please use **curly brackets** (`{` and `}`) and leave spacing between the characters.
    * An exception to this request is for one-liner `if` statements that aren't too long - for
      example, `if(shouldReturn) return;`. Using curly brackets for this sense is completely optional.
    * Curly brackets **must be used with `else` blocks** so that the code is easier to follow.
